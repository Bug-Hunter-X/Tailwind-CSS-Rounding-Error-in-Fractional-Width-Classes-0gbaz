```html
<div class="flex">
  <div class="bg-red-500 p-4 w-1/2"></div>
  <div class="bg-blue-500 p-4 w-1/2"></div>
</div>
```
This code snippet is expected to divide the screen into two equal halves with red and blue backgrounds. However, due to rounding errors in the `w-1/2` class, the two divs might not perfectly add up to 100% width, leaving a small gap or overlap between them.
