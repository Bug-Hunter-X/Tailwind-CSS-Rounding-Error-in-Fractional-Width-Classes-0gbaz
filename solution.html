```html
<div class="flex">
  <div class="bg-red-500 p-4 flex-grow"></div>
  <div class="bg-blue-500 p-4 flex-grow"></div>
</div>
```
This solution utilizes the `flex-grow` utility.  By assigning `flex-grow` to both divs, they will expand equally to fill the available space, preventing gaps or overlaps and ensuring a perfect 50/50 split.
